# Contact Keeper

## Overview

Contact Keeper is a MERN stack application that utilizes MongoDB, Express, React, and Nodejs.
Implementing the CRUD model, this simple application allows the user to create and manage contacts.
JSON Web Tokens are employed for authentication and in turn, support protected routes. This application
calls for users to register, with the ability to log in to their private collection of both personal and professional
contacts. This application relies heavily on the useContext hook to seamlessly incorporate and integrate all the
available components within React, as well as the useReducer hook for state management. The nature of the MERN stack model, and
this application specifically, has produced an environment for a non-SQL database to retain data. This cloud based
approach allows the deployment of this application to scale via hosting services, which in this demonstration, is Heroku.
